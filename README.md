# sprinklers
This was a quick and dirty project using a raspberry pi, a relay board, and 19v transformer supply to control irrigation at my house!

Usage is simple:
* Set up the pi to enable ssh on your home network.
* Edit water.py with correct names and pins for the relays controlling each zone in your yard.
* Make crontab entries to schedule each zone.
